[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long thatEven my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve itMe be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the streetlight

[Chorus: LV]
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradiseWe've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradiseWe keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradiseWe keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-four?The way things is goin', I don't know
[Refrain: LV]Tell me, why are we so blind to seeThat the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Chorus: LV]
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradiseWe've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradiseWe keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradiseWe keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach meIf they can't understand it, how can they reach me?I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

[Chorus: LV]
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradiseWe've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradiseWe keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradiseWe keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
[Refrain: LV]Tell me, why are we so blind to seeThat the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me, why are we so blind to seeThat the ones we hurt are you and me?"
I Got 5 On It,Luniz,Operation Stackola,1995-07-04,https://open.spotify.com/track/4IYKjN1DrYzxKXt0umJqsG,"[Intro: Michael Marshall]
Creep on in, on in, on inWoahSee, I'm ridin' high, woahKinda broke this evening, y'all, so all I got is five, I got five

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chillBut I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I-D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like the cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty
And when it comes to getting anotherstogie
Fools all kick in like Shinobi (Shinobi)
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friendhit Bit
Unless you pull out the fat, crispyFive-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
'Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungsAnd if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb, da-dumb-dumb
I come to school (Nyoom) with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoidin' all the dick teasers, skeezers and weirdos
That be blowin' off the land like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious
Bomb will make a niggy godelirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more growin' pains than Maggie
'Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie
[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
'Cause I got five on itPartner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: Numskull &]
I take sacks to the face whenever I can, don't need no crutchI'm so keyed up till the joint be burnin' my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampaTo burn slow, so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension(Hahahaha)
'Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell, no! You better bring your own spliff, chief ()
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the joint
Stop hittin' 'cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it'Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my POI know I failed 'cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a fattyBut the Tanqueray straight had me
[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)Partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 3: Numskull &]
Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thang got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashishs
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low-budgetStill rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land gettin' smoked with my kinfolk,
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down
Up in the O-A-K, the Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through theE-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the rollerThat's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja (Wouh)
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do,kick in feed'Cause where I be, we needs half like Umfufu
[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)Partner, let's go half on a sack"

When there ain't no where to run
When judgment comes for you (When judgment comes for you)
Now tell me what'cha gonna do (Now tell me what...) When there ain't no where to hide
When judgment comes for you (Cause it's gonna come for you)

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Now feel it, the pain was gettin' me hypеd and so violent
But Wally was the worst of us all
Pump in his chest and hе never knew it
Poor Wally had to fall victim, a casualty
But I lay my soul down and I think it all better when it falls down
Everybody got problems to face to face everyday
With it when there's so many lost souls (Lost souls)

[Layzie Bone]
God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven follow the Lord all 24
7 days, God is who we praise even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keepin' me safe and in my place, say grace
And maybe you people should do to the same (The game)
Recognize a good game man, it's an everyday thang how we gotta maintain

[Krayzie Bone]
Now follow me roll stroll whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit of people that's long gone on their rest;
Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
It's steadily creepin' up on the family
Exactly how many days we got lasting?
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away
[Wish Bone]
Little Eazy's long gone, really wish he would come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go bye bye, all a little thug could do was cry, cry
Why they kill my dog? Damn man, I miss my Uncle Charles ya'll
And he shouldn't be gone, in front of his home
What they did to Boo was wrong (Ooh wrong, ooh wrong...)

[Bizzy Bone]
We choose the way you gonna go into the coffin man
When it comes to Judgement Day
Flame and blaze, and up at The Door
With all of my problems man
What a thankful day
Through the pain I still maintain
Bang! Put it on my grave

[Chorus]
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
[Bizzy Bone]
Hey my niggas, you know that we care
And cough up weed wit a me peoples
[?] and I believe 'em
Rest In Peace, son
When I hit the hater hater, where will I go? This world has been so cruel
And runnin' up when they're hittin 'em strong, Bone

[Wish Bone]
I still feel for you even though your long gone (Wally, Wally)
You always got love from Bone
Eternally, gotta love Little E for lovin' me and my peoples B.O.N.E
Yeah, you put that Bone Thugs on now

[Krayzie Bone]
What's up with murder yall? See my little cousin was hung, somebody was really wrong
Everybody want to test us dog
And Miss Sleazy set up Eazy to fall
You know we be sinnin' and Krayzie intended on endin' it when it ends
Murder come again, again and again
Now tell me whatcha gonna do?

[Layzie Bone]
And now that they see that the world goes round and round and round
Now I'm startin' to see why somedays I was lonely
But it ain't that the world don't love me
But it's like that when I gotta make the money
Faithful, livin' in a hateful world, it's all about our family and how we grow
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives til eternal our soul
[Flesh-N-Bone]
Yeah, and here we roll, cold, with the Thug N Harmony
Lil' punk in the trunk
Set 'em up with the murder
Eazy E died, he gone, and now Bone and Mo! seekin' revenge on this song
Soon to take him head on and he's drunk
Midnight fell, that gotta be wrong
I be bustin' on somethin'
Maintain, chill pill to the brain
My people will not let me tryin' to take one destruction, Bang!
And I'm thuggin' off at the golden gate safely

Keep Their Heads Ringin',Dr. Dre,Friday (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),1995-04-11,https://open.spotify.com/track/7jIujRjK5JKNrMCcAvYUTN,"[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, what up, this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin' on
Thank God it's Friday

[Refrain: KRS-One]
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
Keep their heads ringin'
(Ring ding dongRing-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'
(Ring ding dongRing-a-ding ding ding (uh, yeah) dong)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Nancy Fletcher]

Say what?

That's right

Yeah

So get up, get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular veinAnd maintain to leave blood stains,so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keepin' it real enables me to make another mill,
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga,now let me tell you what I'm worthMore than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E ah keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'
[Hook: Dr. Dre]
(Ring ding dong (uh)Ring-a-ding ding (yeah) ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'
(Ring ding dongRing-a-ding ding ding dong)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect, plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to 'cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you God damn right I'ma gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen KingA black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E ah keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'
[Hook: Dr. Dre]
(Ring ding dong (yeahhh)Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'
(Ring ding dongRing-a-ding ding ding (ha ha) dong)
Yeah, c'mon

[Bridge]
If you want to get on down (uh, yeahhh)
You gotta get on down (c'mon, ha ha)
Just get on down (it's like that)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought 'em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you so, just call me Mop and Glo
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1"", two, twenty-five of pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G
'Cause I rock from summer 'till Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro, So
Check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E ah keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'
[Hook: Dr. Dre]
(Ring ding dong (yeahhhh)Ring-a-ding (uh) ding ding dong)
I keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'
(Ring ding dong (yea, uh)Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
I keep their heads ringin'
(Ring ding dong (get it, get it)Ring-a-ding ding (get it) ding dong)
I keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong (ha ha, yeahhhh)Ring-a-ding ding ding (uh, c'mon) dong)

[Bridge]
If you want to get on down (yeah Death Row back up in that ass. For the one nine nine to the nickle)
You gotta get on down (so all you motherfuckers out there tryna get with this)
Just get on down, ho ohhhh (don't even try it, couldn't see us with binoculars)
If you want to get on down (no diggity, ha ha)
You gotta get on down (yeah, uh, I know you're bobbin' your head)
